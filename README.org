* Build Action Scheduler

  This projects implements a build action scheduler that can execute tasks in
  parallel.

  The scheduler works by:
  1. Identifying paths from all leaf actions (actions with no dependencies) to
     root actions (actions that aren't depended on)
  2. Putting these paths in a priority queue that uses the total path duration
     as the priority
  3. Iterating on getting paths from the priority queue (paths with higher total
     duration come first) and checking if their head action has no pending
     dependencies (i.e., they either have no dependencies or their dependencies
     have been executed). These are considered ready to execute
  4. Adding ready actions to a queue, updating the priority queue paths when
     taking their head action
  5. Whenever an action finishes executing, schedule as many actions as possible
     from the queue, based on the current scheduler capacity (dictated by
     parallelism)
  6. If the scheduler is at full capacity, poll it periodically

  This algorithm makes sure that the scheduler will at every iteration try to
  execute actions from the paths with the largest durations (the most critical
  paths), guaranteeing that given a high parallelism, the wall duration for the
  full scheduler execution will be similar to the critical path duration.
     
** Example execution
   The scheduler application takes action files as input:
   
   #+begin_src bash
   cat <<EOF > test_actions_0.json
   [
     {
       "sha1": "e",
       "duration": 5,
       "dependencies": []
     },
     {
       "sha1": "b",
       "duration": 2,
       "dependencies": [
         "e"
       ]
     },
     {
       "sha1": "c",
       "duration": 3,
       "dependencies": [
         "e"
       ]
     },
     {
       "sha1": "d",
       "duration": 1,
       "dependencies": [
         "b",
         "c"
       ]
     },
     {
       "sha1": "f",
       "duration": 6,
       "dependencies": []
     },
     {
       "sha1": "g",
       "duration": 6,
       "dependencies": [
         "d",
         "f"
       ]
     },
     {
       "sha1": "x",
       "duration": 6,
       "dependencies": [
         "g"
       ]
     },
     {
       "sha1": "y",
       "duration": 6,
       "dependencies": [
         "x"
       ]
     },
     {
       "sha1": "z",
       "duration": 6,
       "dependencies": [
         "c"
       ]
     }
   ]
   EOF
   #+end_src

   Run the scheduler application CLI and give it the actions file created above:

   #+begin_src bash :results code raw
   bazel run //org_fraggles/build_action_scheduler:build_action_scheduler_bin \
         -- \
         --parallelism 5 \
         --actions-file test_actions_0.json 
   #+end_src

   Scheduler status updates will be streamed to stderr:

   And a report will be printed to stdout, showing:
   1. The =action_execution_history= based on action execution start times
   2. The critical path and its duration
